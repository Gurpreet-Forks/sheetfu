How to contribute to Sheetfu
============================

(this is pretty much a copy of the Flask contribution documentation).

Thank you for considering contributing to Sheetfu! This is a very young library,
easy to understand, where lots can be added.


Support questions
-----------------

For questions about your own code ask on `Stack Overflow`_. Search with
Google first using:
``site:stackoverflow.com sheetfu {search term, exception message, etc.}``

.. _Stack Overflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/sheetfu?sort=linked


Reporting issues
----------------

Use the issue tracker for this:

- Describe what you expected to happen.
- If possible, include a `minimal, complete, and verifiable example`_ to help
  us identify the issue. This also helps check that the issue is not with your
  own code.
- Describe what actually happened. Include the full traceback if there was an
  exception.
- List your Python and Sheetfu version.

Submitting patches
------------------

- Include tests if your patch is supposed to solve a bug, and explain
  clearly under which circumstances the bug happens. Make sure the test fails
  without your patch.
- Try to follow `PEP8`_.
- Use the utils at your disposition in test folders to mock api requests.
- Every mock request should be put in the fixture folder.
- Tests are run with pytest.

First time setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Download and install the `latest version of git`_.
- Configure git with your `username`_ and `email`_::

        git config --global user.name 'your name'
        git config --global user.email 'your email'

- Make sure you have a `GitHub account`_.
- Fork Sheetfu to your GitHub account by clicking the `Fork`_ button.
- `Clone`_ your GitHub fork locally::

        git clone https://github.com/{username}/sheetfu
        cd sheetfu

- Add the main repository as a remote to update later::

        git remote add socialpoint-labs https://github.com/socialpoint-labs/sheetfu
        git fetch socialpoint-labs

- Create a virtualenv::

        python3 -m venv env
        . env/bin/activate
        # or "env\Scripts\activate" on Windows

- Install Sheetfu in editable mode with development dependencies::

        pip install -e ".[dev]"

Start coding
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Create a branch to identify the issue you would like to work on (e.g.
  ``2287-dry-test-suite``)
- Using your favorite editor, make your changes, `committing as you go`_.
- Try to follow `PEP8`_.
- Include tests that cover any code changes you make. Make sure the test fails
  without your patch.
- Push your commits to GitHub and `create a pull request`_.
- Celebrate ðŸŽ‰

Running the tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Run the basic test suite with::

    pytest

This only runs the tests for the current environment. Travis-CI will run the full
suite when you submit your pull request.


Running test coverage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Generating a report of lines that do not have test coverage can indicate
where to start contributing. Run ``pytest`` using ``coverage`` and generate a
report on the terminal and as an interactive HTML document::

    coverage run -m pytest
    coverage report
    coverage html
    # then open htmlcov/index.html

Read more about `coverage <https://coverage.readthedocs.io>`_.


Semantic versioning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sheetfu follows the 2.0.0 specification of Semantic Versioning. All version number should follow the following format::

    v<major>.<minor>.<patch>
    example: v3.5.1

Read more about `semantic versioning <https://semver.org/>`_.

AngularJS commit convention
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sheetfu follows the AngularJS commit specifications. Commit messages should be structured with the following format::

    <type>(<scope>): <subject>
    <BLANK LINE>
    <body>
    <BLANK LINE>
    <footer>

Allowed <type> values are the following::

    feat (feature)
    fix (bug fix)
    docs (documentation)
    style (formatting)
    refactor
    test (when adding missing tests)
    chore (maintain)

It's important to follow this commit specification, as the version numbers will be generated accordingly to the commit messages since the previous version.
It's also important to specify which commits include breaking changes in the commit footer.

make targets
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sheetfu provides a ``Makefile`` with various shortcuts. They will ensure that
all dependencies are installed.

- ``make test`` runs the basic test suite with ``pytest``
- ``make cov`` runs the basic test suite with ``coverage``
